                        Climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, challenges in the 21st century.<br>
                        In this project, at a European level with partners from four different countries, climate change and its supposed consequences for different European countries from the far north to the far south will be examined from different perspectives.<br>
                        This is to raise awareness of the urgency of our immediate action.<br>
                        <br>
                        A qualitative study is intended to provide information on which alternative actions and waivers in which areas each individual can achieve the greatest savings in greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
                        Furthermore, it should be investigated why various countries in Europe are making very slow progress in climate policy and failing to keep their promises.<br>
                        <br>
                        In particular, it is to be examined in various European countries how willing people are to change their behavior or to renounce.<br>
                        In addition, the aim is to investigate the motivations behind a negative attitude in order to better understand these people and to approach them.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the intensive cooperation of students from different European countries, they acquire intercultural competence.<br>
                        By processing all materials in English, the students improve their English language skills.<br>
                        By presenting their results in their school, at the trans-European project workshops, at information days and before panel discussions, the pupils strengthen their presentation and communication skills.<br>
