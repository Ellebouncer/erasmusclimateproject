Strömbackaskolan offers 14 national programs, the individual program and a specially designed program specializing in dance. About half of the students choose to apply to vocational programs, and half of them head for university studies. The school has a close cooperation with local companies and we focus on entrepreneurship and young enterprise. The school also focus on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and we are trying to be in the frontline when it comes to technic and automation. The school strives to develop international cooperation such as experience exchanges for teachers and students. Piteå Municipality has a focus of developing a “Sustainable Municipality” and to carry out this the schools has a central role as educating the new generations of citizens. Therefore, it is crucial for all schools to focus on Education for sustainable development and one of the ways of doing this is to participate in different international projects. The school has just ended one ERASMUS+ project called "European student climate report" and this is a follow up on that project. As Sustainability has been targeting, the school has developed methods for working in that field. One of them is the energy and environmental role-playing game, where students in grade one have been acting countries and occupy positions of the various countries to debate the issues. Strömbacka school has also got the award of "School for sustainable development" (Skola för hållbar utveckling)", an award that the Swedish National Agency for Education is responsible for.</br>

                        Around us, locally, nationally and globally we see a growing concern for the changes in environment regarding weather patterns and the consequences thereof. Being involved in a project like this will further deepen the knowledge and awareness among students and teachers so we can better understand the reasons for what is happening. We want to learn more about the political actions, which have been taken in Europe and what impact they have had for the environment. We also want to investigate what can be done in the future by political leaders and decision makers in Europe to help improve the current environmental status.</br>

                        1) General information</br>
                        </br>
                        Our Institute “Polo 3 Fano” consists of two Vocational Secondary Schools and three Technical Secondary Schools.</br>

                        Our Vocational Secondary Schools give the students the possibility to acquire the Regional Vocational Qualification in the different sections at the end of the third year.</br>
                        The various institutions of Polo 3 are located in the centre of Fano and they involve:</br>
                        • Students: about 1100</br>

                        </br>
                        2) school's motivations for participating in the project</br>
                        </br>
                        Our school is particularly concerned with Environment and Pollution as the Climate change is one of the most important topics we always include in our school curriculum. We would like to go deep into the subject matter and let all our students experience new activities in this field. This is a great challenge for our school.</br>
                        </br>
                        3) key people</br>
                        </br>
                        The key people who primarily carry out the project are the following:</br>
                        -Tallevi Benedetta, English teacher</br>
                        - Spendolini Nicoletta, Graphic Design teacher</br>
                        Together with the help of other teachers who could take over their role, should these people leave the facility in the future:</br>
                        - Rinaldi Laura, Science and Biology teacher</br>
                        - Piermattei Arianna, Italian and history teacher</br>
                        - Penserini Loris, ICT teacher</br>
                        </br>
                        4) special experience or expertise</br>
                        </br>
                        In the past 5 years we also took part in other European projects about Environment entitled GREEEN I and GREEEN II, therefore some of our students and teachers have already experienced environmentally frinedly activities at school and during the mobilities in Spain and Ireland.One of our schools, F. Seneca, is also specialized in Graphic Design and Communication, so we could have a specific role in this field, by creating the logo of the project, the leaflet, some advertising videos, a poster, etc. that are important aspects to document results and for the dissemination of the project.
